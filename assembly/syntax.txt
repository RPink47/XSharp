LDIA - Loads an immediate 14-bit value into the A register
COMP - Executes the instruction code in the ALU, jump if necessary
       Jumps are based on the ALU output.
NOOP - Nothing!
HALT - Stops the program execution.

Example program:

1 | LDIA 4
2 | COMP A JGT // Jumps if the result is greater than 0
3 | LDIA 69 // Loads a junk value into A register
4 | HALT
5 | LDIA 100
6 | HALT

After the execution of the program, the A register should have the value 100.
