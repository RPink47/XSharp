LDIA - Loads a signed 14-bit immediate into the A register
COMP - Executes the instruction code in the ALU, jump if necessary
       Jumps are based on the ALU output.
NOOP - Nothing!
HALT - Stops the program execution.

Example program:

1 | LDIA 4
2 | COMP A JGT // Jumps if the result is greater than 0
3 | LDIA 69 // Loads a junk value into A register
4 | HALT
5 | LDIA 100
6 | HALT

After the program's execution, the A register should store 100.
